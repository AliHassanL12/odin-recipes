    <!-- Description of Risotto -->

    <p> Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked in a broth to a creamy consistency.
        The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables.
        Many types of risotto contain butter, wine, and onion.
        It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.
        Saffron was originally used for flavour and its attractive yellow colour.</p>
