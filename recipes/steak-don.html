    <!-- Description -->

    <p> The Chaliapin Steak is an original Japanese steak.
        It is a dish made in 1936 for the Russian opera singer Feodor Chaliapin when he visited Japan.
        At the time, he was suffering from toothaches and said, "I want to eat a tender steak." 
        This dish was devised to answer to his request.</p>
